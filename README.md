## what is this?
This is a prototype for a hybrid chat system that i was working on for another project.

just seeing what limitations i am working with.

## Why?
its been a while since i have built a chat in websocket fashion, and even longer since i have used socket.io even though it may not be the the software i am going to be using in the project itself.
